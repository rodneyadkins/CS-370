Introduction
I was asked to design a non-player character for the game of treasure hunt utilizing Deep Q-learning (DQN) to create the AI agent. DQN is an extension of the AI reinforcement learning algorithm known as Q learning. This approach is model free and uses a reward value for a state-action pair. DQN extends this by utilizing deep neural networks to estimate the Q value for each state-action pair. The game files written in Pyton was given to me as starter code as well as much of the Jupyter Notebook file.
I added the code for DQN and epsilon decay. I then tuned the model to perform well.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
As a computer scientists we are responsible for many aspect of computer design and application. A computer scientist may focus on different aspects of this broad spectrum of topics. It is important to have a background that is broad and an attitude that is open to learn the details of our current assignment. Computer science is always changing and a computer scientists learning never ends. The future od technology is in our hands and we must meet this responsibility with professionism and an open mind.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
As a computer scientist I appproach each problem as a chalenege. First I apply analytics to identify the goal. Then In evaluate what is needed resource wise to solve the problem at hand. These resources might be addtional learning, addtional teammates, existing software or libraries, or hardware. After the goal is defined and resources secured I develop a solution. The solution is test and refined in an iterative process until the goal has been satisfied. 

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
Computer science and many other technologies do bring up ethical concerns. We must be professional and have a high level of moral values. We must review all standards and guidlines provide by governments and standards organizations. It is important to make sure a solution to a problem does not harm human life, society, or our environment. We also need to keep peoples feelings and welfare in mind. DEI concerns are real whether they are currently popular in the media at any given times. All people deserve to be treated in a caring maner, this may not always be equal or even perceived as fair by all. My motto is to do your best to be a decent human being. At the very least, treat poeple the way you would like to be treated, but also keep in mind that may not be enough. A better saying is to treat people the way they want to be treated. This is harder because we don't always know what they want. We can can attempt this by keeping an open mind, following societal norms, and gathering feedback. We must make every effort to do no harm to end users or the organizaition we represent.
